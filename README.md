# ophidia
pathfinding mod based off from [roger1337](https://github.com/roger1337)
- used the name from [roger1337](https://github.com/roger1337)
- added basic improvemnets in QOL
- fully functional mod for 1.8.9 (to be moved to 1.20+ due to Hypixel Skyblock 1.20 requirements)
- called it fragtone for the funnies (based off Baritone)

# what does this do?
- pathfinds up to 10,000 considered blocks (medium-ish distance)
- smooth, mostly non-detectable movement (tried on anticheat-test.com & alpha.hypixel.net)
- functions great for varying levels of speed, especially in hypixel skyblock

# todo
- add long distance, stable pathfinding
- add javascript/script file integration
- add 1.20 integration
- integrate into notenoughorchestration (custom automated dungeons frag bot orchestrator)
